- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy, I'm 28 and I live in France
- Iâ€™m interested in Front-End Web Development, and I enjoy learning new things about it. I have some side project ideas that I would love to develop to practice my skills. I'm basically learning on my own.

- I also like UX and UI design

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js
